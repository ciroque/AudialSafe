# Croak [aka Audial Safe]

A reference-implmentation using the Web Audio APIs available in HTML 5.

The application itself requests access to the microphone and, given permission, allows
the user to monitor the ambient noise level. There is a vu-meter style widget that
shows the current levels, displays for the Mean and Peak RMS values observed, and several
settings that allow customization of the alerts that can be triggered.
